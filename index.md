## My photos

.flickr_badge_image img {border: 1px solid #BADA55 !important; padding:1px; margin:2px;}

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload ~~all~~ some ("Good" ones) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). Honestly, the 1000 photo rule is more than stupid. I'm planning to move to Zonerama once I can be absolutely sure that they won't do that like Flickr.

## My other online stuff, like social media

## May I ask some questions?
~~No u.~~ Obviously, sure. You can even comment below to ask even more question, eh?

### Hobbies?
<img src="./assets/model_un.jpg" alt="Name tags of attended MUN conferences" align="right" height="200"/>

Coding, mapping, commenting on local/global affairs (Some posted on Tumblr), model UN, and listening to sick beats ~~as well as memeing~~ are things I do a lot. And Anime sometimes (≤3 series per year). Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports ~~given that me being a not-so-sporty kid~~.

Yes, I do model UN, even though many people believe I'm the *last* person who would do that. I consider myself more realistic than most people, who are usually idealistic (Probably because their school trained them so for the award). I was memed so hard in MariMUN 2019 that I almost lost all reasons to exist.

### Hardware?
A school-provided fully-stickered repaired-once MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) plus several shared VPS from online people ~~comrades~~ and free services. That's it. I mean, after all, I'm not the super-hyped computer science guy anyway. They're hobbies and will remain so.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://github.com/simonguozirui) did and went abroad at the same time as he did, though he's 1 year older than me. But honestly, I know more people in Montréal than in Shanghai.

Oh, and I speak [Shanghainese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese), a dialect of the Wu language, which is a disappearing language.

### What about a formal resume, *please?*
<img src="./assets/uno4.jpeg" alt="+4" align="right"/>

No u. *skirt skirt dab dab*

### Hey, you look cool. How can I support you?
You can [buy my services](/services) or [donate to me](/donate)!

### What other stuff are there on this website?
You can have a look at the [sitemap](/sitemap).
