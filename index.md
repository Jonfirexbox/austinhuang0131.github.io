Hi there! I'm a high school student who [writes JavaScript, operates chatbots](#my-coding-projects), [helps other projects](#projects-i-am-involved-in), [translates websites](#my-translations), [takes photos](#my-photos), studies, and [explores online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff). You may reach me using [these methods](./contact).

If you need a job description, that'll be "high school student/freelance developer". I just put everything on my website, it's not actually a *resume*.

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload ~~all~~ some ("Good" ones) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). Honestly, the 1000 photo rule is more than stupid. I'm currently moving most of my photos to [Zonerama](https://austinhuang0131.zonerama.com). I also post loyalty-free ones on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@austinhuang).

## May I ask some questions?
~~No u.~~ Obviously, sure. You can even comment below to ask even more question, eh?

### Hobbies?
<img src="./assets/model_un.jpg" alt="Name tags of attended MUN conferences" align="right" width="300"/>

Coding, mapping, commenting on local/global affairs (Some posted on [Tumblr](https://blog.austinhuang.me) - Oh, and I only used it for the free custom domain, I don't really like Tumblr), model UN, and listening to sick beats ~~as well as memeing~~ are things I do a lot. And Anime quite rarely (≤3 series per year). Skating, softball and badminton, especially, are my favourite sports ~~given that me being a not-so-sporty kid~~.

Yes, I do model UN, even though many people believe I'm the *last* person who would do that. I consider myself more realistic than most people, who are usually idealistic.

### Hardware?
A school-provided fully-stickered repaired-once MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) plus several shared VPS from online people ~~comrades~~ and free services (e.g. [Glitch](https://glitch.com)). That's it. I mean, after all, I'm not the super-hyped computer science guy anyway. They're hobbies and will remain so.

### You said you're from...Shanghai?
Yeah. I actually went to the same high school as [@simonguozirui](https://simonguo.tech/) did and went abroad at the same time as he did, though he's 1 year older than me. He's the *hacky* kind, I'm more the *pragmatic* kind.

Honestly, I know more people in Montréal than in Shanghai. <small>Mostly due to model UN, since it's more a social event than a competition, you just can't deny that straight truth.</small>

Oh, and I speak [Shanghainese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghainese), a dialect of the Wu language, which is a disappearing language.

### What about a formal resume, *please?*
<img src="./assets/uno4.jpeg" alt="+4" class="disappear" align="right"/>

I'm likely not going to put my resume on the website.

If I applied for a job, a resume would be provided.

### Hey, you look cool. How can I support you?
You can [request my services](/services) or [donate to me](/donate)!

### What other stuff are there on this website?
You can have a look at the [sitemap](/sitemap).
