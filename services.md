## Bot and Translation Services
I can write you a Discord/Telegram bot, or do some translation work for you (Chinese-English). Below are groups I've successfully worked with.

### Discord
> @The Double-Eyed Bus developed a bot to prevent raids. Was kind enough to develop new features as the request grew larger and fixed bugs. All this done in nice time period considering he coded for free. Great communication. Recommended and you can also hire him to develop bots for very affordable rates.

### Terms

* I work on a postpaid basis, meaning you pay *after* I deliver. Still, you may choose to pay forward/deposit/whatever, I don't mind. I may ask for your budget, these are non-binding.
* Support (i.e. bug fixes, adapt changes, etc.) is performed for free. New features, however, are negotiated separately.
* I do not offer hosting other than Glitch. You are expected to bring your own device.
* I will reject any order involving userbots. This applies to Telegram as well, even though they are not explicitly prohibited.
