**If you're going to ask a moderator, BE PATIENT. Sending another message will delay the response.**


## Porting issues
*Skip this section if you're getting a new number.*

Be patient. If enough time has passed (3 hours for cell phones, 24 hours for VoIP/landlines), check the following:

* Have you paid off all outstanding balances in your former provider?
* Is your account in your former provider closed by itself? Verify by logging into your former provider's self-serve online. If the account is not closed, **DO NOT close it manually! You will lose your number!** This should be done automatically.

If you answer "yes" to all of the above, look at other possible reasons below.

If none of the reasons solve your problem, [ask a moderator](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Knowledge-Base/The-Public-Mobile-Moderator-Team/ta-p/251759) as it is probably a stuck port.

## General issues
All the reasons of "I can't use my phone!!! ugggggh" happening, from the most to the least probable, except porting issues:

### Improper APN settings.
See [here](https://apn-canada.gishan.net/en/apn/public-mobile) for the proper setting.

### Your phone isn't compatible.
The IMEI checker frequently gives false positives, so it should not be trusted for compatibility. (However, it is still recommended to run the checker before registration just to make sure your phone isn't reported as "Lost/Stolen").

Go [here](https://www.frequencycheck.com/carrier-compatibility/Lzarn/public-mobile-canada/devices), put your device model in the box, and press "Search". It'll tell you if your device is compatible or not. If not, get a new phone. Too bad.

### Your phone isn't unlocked.
Ask your former provider. It should be done free of charge.

If the unlock wasn't done properly, ask again.

If still not, your former provider is violating the Wireless Code. [CCTS them immediately.](https://www.ccts-cprst.ca/for-consumers/complaints/complaint-form/)

### Your phone is broken.
Yep, [that has happened before.](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Getting-Started/Inserted-new-activated-and-unlcoked-sim-but-service-signal-not/m-p/267727/highlight/true#M47290) That's your fault in its entirety.

### There was a mistake in putting in the SIM number.
Log into Self-Serve and there's "Change SIM Card" below "My Profile". Correct it.

### The SIM is defective.
**Least likely situation.** Please test your SIM in other unlocked devices before choosing this as an answer.

[Ask a moderator](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Knowledge-Base/The-Public-Mobile-Moderator-Team/ta-p/251759). You *should* get a free replacement.

If not ([As happened before!](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Getting-Started/Defective-sim-no-refund/m-p/244614)), [CCTS'ing them](https://www.ccts-cprst.ca/for-consumers/complaints/complaint-form/) is your final option.
