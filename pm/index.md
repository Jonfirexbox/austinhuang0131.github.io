Yeah, Public Mobile... Anyways, this guide is created because:

* There are many easy questions that we have to repeatedly answer in the community;
* Moderator response time is struggling to keep itself within the 48 hours limit;
* I'm lazy.

So here it goes:

## Urgent issues
* [I just joined PM but my phone doesn't work!](./sim)
* [I can't change plans from self-serve!](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Self-Serve/Can-t-switch-plans/m-p/248454) (Your account is probably suspended which will require moderator intervention.)
* $10/month users: [Why do I have outgoing calls to XXX5804001 (Voicemail) using up my minutes?](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Announcements/Plan-updates-new-10-limited-talk-and-text-plan/m-p/233167/highlight/true#M15031)

Any other payment (Failed/Extra charge) or usage (Problems in counting minutes/data) issue should go directly to [asking a moderator](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Knowledge-Base/The-Public-Mobile-Moderator-Team/ta-p/251759).

## Normal issues
### How is the contribution level determined?
[It's a secret.](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Rewards/List-of-Reward-Levels/m-p/267647) All we know is that it's done between 1st and 6th of every month.

### I can't access self-serve!
You probably forgot your password, I assume, if you registered for one already.

As of now, the retrieve password link is a decoration. You need to [ask a moderator](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Knowledge-Base/The-Public-Mobile-Moderator-Team/ta-p/251759) for now.

### PM is sending me Koodo offers! Is Telus shutting down PM?
[No.](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Getting-Started/public-mobiles-future/m-p/255888/highlight/true#M45088)

### The prices of 30-day plans and their 90-day counterpart are the same!
[Difference: The data spreads across 90 days instead of 30 days.](https://productioncommunity.publicmobile.ca/t5/Announcements/Plan-updates-new-10-limited-talk-and-text-plan/m-p/233185/highlight/true#M15040)
