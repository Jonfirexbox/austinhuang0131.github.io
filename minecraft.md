I believe you guys are mature enough to interpret "common sense and respect".

## Basics
### Discord
You should join it: https://discord.gg/StdGDuj

Your messages in the Minecraft server will be relayed to channel `#minecraft-playroom` on the Discord server above. Vice versa.

### Cash & Economy
You get 100 in-game cash on join. You can get more cash by [voting](#vote-for-us).

Currently, more economic infrastructure are in the works. We do have a market (at Rainbow metro station, north of Spawn) operating at limited capacity. You can ask `im@austinhuang.me` for a stall.

### Staff

* `austinhuang` - Responsible for advertising and the plugin stuff. [Website](./) / [Contact](./contact).
* `michaelnj1` - Responsible for the VPS and legal stuff. [Website](https://michaelo.online/) / [Contact](https://michaelo.online/Contact-Me/).

We're both equally responsible for the map. We're **not** hiring staff.

### Claiming lands
We use [Residence](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/residence.11480/). Currently, the land price of this server is **0.75 in-game cash per square metre**. Height is always 256 (Entire height).

### RAM
The server is currently running with 2GB RAM allocated. If demand suffices, it can expand to 4GB.

## Transportation
This server enphasizes on convenience in terms of letting players explore the map.

### Metro
There are two Metro lines in the server. Some metro stations have private exits that are only meant to be used by authorized users. Any *active* user can request one and the staff will deem if it's possible to construct one.

* C Trail, a trail going north-south, crossing the Red & Blue Strait bridge. Passes Spawn, Rainbow station, and Market.
* A1 Trail, a trail linking A and B Trails, going north off B Trail from Sandy Bay, passing Mikey's House, crossing B Trail again, to Île Sainte-Hélène.
* B1 Trail, going west off B Trail along the Saint-Denis River, to Ellis' House.

### Waterway
#### North Sea
If you sail north from Rainbow metro station, you will encounter a huge coral reef.
#### Saint-Denis River
Generally wide river with different biomes along the shores. There is 1 public pier called *St-Denis West Pier* accessible by Trail B1 (Very close to Trail B). There is also 1 private pier at Ellis' House. Expect more public piers built in the future.

## Why cracked?
This server started off as a private server among my classmates, many of whom are barred from buying actual Minecraft due to financial restraints, which includes me. As such, I understand that some people just can't afford Minecraft *with their own money* (Parents' money isn't your own!) and I just want to make a server that is affordable to play.

**We do comply with server listing regulations and we will refrain from posting this server on listings that does not have a "Cracked" tag/category.**

This paragraph exists because someone did shout at me once:

> SmashUltimate101 » you support free players?
>
> SmashUltimate101 » sorry sir but im gonna have to ask you to stop ruining the community
>
> SmashUltimate101 » thnak you.

If I'm making a server that is nice and clean, I'm not *ruining* the community by letting more people play.
