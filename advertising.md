**August 6, 2018: IMPORTANT!!! PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING!!!**

On August 3, 2018, Twitter user [@h0nda1337](https://twitter.com/h0nda1337) scraped Discord.me and obtained data on **users and list of Discord.me-listed servers they're part of**. Although his lookup tool has been taken down by Discord, other people have retrieved the database and proceeded to publicize it. As a result, not only raiding activity increased, our privacy is also undermined.

Discord.me has dealt with this situation appriopriately, which should be applauded of. They have released Bot Check mode which adds a layer of security over your listing on the website. **It is, however, not enabled by default. As such, I'd like to recommend all users to enable the option immediately by editing your server from its dashboard.**

Efforts are being made to stop such actions. If you are raided due to this incident, or you spotted another userbot using the database OR scraping to make a new database, please [contact me](https://discord.gg/013MqTM1p1qm52VcZ).

## Free people for your Discord server!

Server owners hate me! But today you'll see this one crazy and simple trick to increase your Discord server's size IMMEDIATELY!

Want to list more places to advertise? Please contact me at [https://discord.gg/013MqTM1p1qm52VcZ](https://discord.gg/013MqTM1p1qm52VcZ). **This server is for support relating to this guide, NOT FOR ADVERTISING YOUR OWN SERVER!**

* **To add your server-listing server into this page**, your server should have *at least* 500 members (Reaching the population size does **NOT** guarantee a spot.) and a well-maintained listing (Expired invites are frequently cleaned, tidy categories, etc.). This **does not** mean that this guide is only suitable for servers with 500+ people which has became, surprisingly, a common misconception made by a lot of people.
* Currently, there is no restriction in adding listing websites or bots, as long as they're functional.
* No bot-listing servers.
