## Free people for your Discord server!

Server owners hate me! But today you'll see this one crazy and simple trick to increase your Discord server's size IMMEDIATELY!

Want to list more places to advertise? Please contact me at [https://discord.gg/013MqTM1p1qm52VcZ](https://discord.gg/013MqTM1p1qm52VcZ). **This server is for support relating to this guide, NOT FOR ADVERTISING YOUR OWN SERVER!**

* **To add your server-listing server into this page**, your server should have *at least* 500 members (Reaching the population size does **NOT** guarantee a spot.) and a well-maintained listing (Expired invites are frequently cleaned, tidy categories, etc.). This **does not** mean that this guide is only suitable for servers with 500+ people which has became, surprisingly, a common misconception made by a lot of people.
* Currently, there is no restriction in adding listing websites or bots, as long as they're functional.
* No bot-listing servers.
