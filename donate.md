## Donation platforms

In order of preference:

* Recurring: [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/austinhuang0131) and [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/austinhuang/donate).
* Recurring and one-time: [Donorbox](https://donorbox.org/austinhuang) and [Flattr](https://flattr.com/@austinhuang).
* One-time only: [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/austinhuang).

Note:

* GitHub Sponsors will match your donations, so I get twice the amount. The con is that they only take cards.
* I strongly discourage the use of PayPal, but if that's your only choice, then please consider paying [fees](https://thefeecalculator.com/) for me as well. (I currently do not pay Stripe fees.)

## Bank transfer

* Interac E-transfer: `im@austinhuang.me`, has autodeposit, security question not needed.
* SEPA: Please email me first.

## Gift cards

I accept most virtual gift cards that are valid in Canada, plus Rechargeable Tim Card. Please email me first.

## Cryptos

I generally don't take cryptocurrencies, but if you have to, use the following:

* BTC: `12tgbn6BoJyQDuRdN5fgA2fi9UKnhxXaCi`
* ETH: `0x6f21441a34f9F5784d2A34f8A8e604B4f88531d1`
* LTC: `LMNRZxHrs9s46f6fpYdvPwPm258ypnY1Tk`
* BCH: `qqf6j75rnpref5nl0s0p8zky377myjdp8y8m8l42ff`
  * For all 4 currencies above, you can also send to `austinhuang0131@gmail.com` if you have a Coinbase account (Avoids network fees).
* XLM: Either `GDXLUCKYAA4DX53NMDKYBLW6ON6YHM2WTMEAVFDBIMXVZWNKCVPPUITN` (Federated: `austinhuang*keybase.io`), or send to Coinbase above
