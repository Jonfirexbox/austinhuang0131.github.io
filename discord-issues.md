title: My view on the Issues of Discord
description: Crimes, staff, and the money. Maybe that social media platform you rely on every day isn't as glorious as you think.

In response to [this well-written article](https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-fuckdiscord) from Cadence Ember, which I have collaborated with them on, I decided to write an article myself. This article will try to supplement Cadence's. I welcome [discussions](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131.github.io/issues).

* [An addendum on Cadence's article](#an-addendum-on-cadence's-article)
* [The Law](#the-law)
* [The Culture](#the-culture)
* [The Money](#the-money)
* [Conclusion: The Attitude](#conclusion-the-attitude)
* [Some personal anecdotes](#some-personal-anecdotes)
* [Two supplementary comments](#two-supplementary-comments)

## An addendum on Cadence's article

While I appreciate their determination on educating the public about the issues of Discord, which encouraged me to write *this* article, there are several points I want to make:

* Don't swear.
* The opening 1/4 is a bit too technical. This article will only address user aspects.
* In the middle, the "Disboard Admin" was me. There is a screenshot, in which I'll clarify certain points:
    1. **I am speaking at my own capacity; I do not speak at DISBOARD's capacity.** This applies to *any* article.
    2. In no way am I trying to generalize people who report illegal servers to us as "alt-right". There are quite some vigilantes who identify with these (or similar) ideologies, which I do not necessarily agree with. I will further explain in [The Culture](#the-culture).
    3. In no way am I *refusing* to cooperate with Discord. I am perfectly open to any cooperation with Discord in order to serve the spirit of law, *should* it happen. Except it doesn't. I will explain this in [The Law](#the-law).
    4. Yes, I did receive threats from an ex-staff of Discord (the account no longer has the staff badge), who was (or still is, just switched account?) a T&S member at that time. In the spirit of respect, I will not name the person nor provide the screenshot, but it did happen.

## The Law

> I think the biggest thing is law enforcement needs to work with discord, essentially if they were to set up a honey pot to go after these people discord wouldn’t shut it down as law enforcement is behind said server and logging each person who shares something. I mean I do see why discord shuts these servers right down is because it stops the spread but the problem is, shutting down a discord does not solve the problem. It’s only a temporary fix until they create another one. Discord is kinda lazy in terms of reporting said stuff to law enforcement. I mean honestly there are a lot of vigilante type organization that go after people like that -- within legal bounds of course, like keeping in touch with authories before doing some actions -- perhaps after college I could help some of those and work with them. It would be nice to be apart of a solution. I mean one of the biggest things is also maybe finding a way to approach discord and help them create a new policy that illegal servers get reported to authorities.

From an active vigilante of illegal content. Sadly, Discord banned him.

> Wish @discordapp had safer ways to report law-breaking or even just ToS-breaking servers. It's frustrating knowing that they'll stay up without being reported, but to report them you have to subject yourself to it and risk having your account disabled as well.

From [a DISBOARD support member](https://nitter.net/TheBorksie/status/1187835840401154050), who was banned by Discord *on duty*.

I remember seeing the response of "why should you be in an illegal server at the first place?" which strike me as extremely absurd. Where's the "innocent until proven guilty"? Are we going to use guilty *by association*? It's called [a fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy), which Discord T&S, not willing to spend *any* effort in even understanding the situation, actively endorses. They just want the problem to *go away* on the surface, not knowing Discord has become a codeword for "conducting sketchy businesses": [Carding](https://onezero.medium.com/inside-discords-thriving-black-market-for-stolen-credit-cards-and-gift-cards-323be0256586), [carding again](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cybercriminals-are-doing-big-business-in-the-gaming-chat-app-discord/), [scalping](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/11/discord-scalpers-harry-styles-ticket-resale-verified-fan/602647/), [zoom-bombing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/doj-says-zoom-bombing-is-a-crime/), [sexual crimes](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200402000656), [more sexual crimes](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/crime/online-gaming-app-discord-used-to-lure-teens-into-trafficking-experts-say/67-3de008b7-d792-4a33-9fe6-8ae02977899f), [even more sexual crimes](https://gizmodo.com/discord-has-a-child-porn-problem-1793682247) (seriously, go to YouTube and look for people trying to bait predators), [kidnapping an officer](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/cleveland/news/press-releases/man-arrested-in-connection-with-an-attempt-to-kidnap-law-enforcement), [all sorts of crime](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/01/29/discord-the-2-billion-gamers-paradise-coming-to-terms-with-data-thieves-child-groomers-and-fbi-investigators/#61e9791a3741)... No wonder why it gets named by the British police as [hacker software](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/is-your-child-secretly-a-hacker-discord-and-tor-browser-appear-in-west-midlands-police-line-up-3984547). And, of course, eyes from the Law are all on it.

You may argue: "but other platforms also have these things!" Let's take another example: Telegram. They might not have a good reputation either, but they *act*. They have [a simple 3-line don't-do's](https://telegram.org/tos), they have measures to counter each of them, and they are (I hope) transparent.

* "Use our service to send spam or scam users." They have [dedicated measures](https://telegram.org/faq_spam) for spammers, and scamming bots are applied ["SCAM" tag](https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots#scam-alerts) publicly, with [a dedicated account to report them](https://t.me/notoscam).
* "Promote violence on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc." They stop terrorism, and [tally it daily](https://t.me/s/isiswatch).
* "Post illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc." They stop child porn, and [tally it daily](https://t.me/s/stopca).

And look at how Discord responds to them.

* [Staff abuse and lack of clarity on rules](https://redd.it/9tdnl9). Same happened [on Partnered servers](https://redd.it/b4dm62).
* Extrajudicial bans, eg. [on underage dating](https://cadence.moe/i/367b08).
* [Mass automatic bans that was written off as an issue in spam detection](https://redd.it/dcemhh).
* Tell you to *keep* whatever illegal content you're going to report, as once the messages are deleted, [they're gone](https://dis.gd/serverid).
* No "good samantarian law". You are implicated simply for *reporting* illegal content.

The first two **removes** guidance to Discord server owners. By cutting off whatever grass that appears above ground, not only illegal servers move underground and cause more harm while avoiding detection, legitimate activities (like "13-17" servers) cannot protect themselves from the growing harm either: A lose-lose situation. The middle one simply causes user frustration and errodes trust in Discord. The last two **discourages** Discord users reporting illegal content, therefore **contributes** to the rise of abuses, from raids, to serious sex crimes.

Since August 2019, Discord makes [transparency reports](https://blog.discord.com/discord-transparency-report-april-dec-2019-7e6d43a9bcb8). Except, they are just showing numbers in a very general way, with no specific mention on *what* is happening and *what* measures are taken. Who are ya lying to?

As a staff of multiple public server listings, the most notable one being an administrator of DISBOARD, I see **no cooperation** from Discord whatsoever regarding enforcing the law. Instead of having an active Support team (DISBOARD has 8 Support members that are nominated based on merit, aka. previous activity in assisting others. We do not have an application form.) that responds to user reports and even takes time in [organizing 3rd-party ToS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hwTpy10BVl9vbdXjoaSHO_KwF5O2GlAzuaY4IXO-cm8/edit), what we see is not only the absence of guidance, but also their Twitter *discourage* users from server listings (being the ONLY source for servers to get most members), [not only once](https://nitter.net/discord/status/1208918203608514561), [but twice](https://nitter.net/discord/status/1043761883982049282). We research news articles about us ourselves, as we are the number 1 result on Google and that equals larger scrutiny. Discord, as a platform, has a much larger scrutiny on them, yet their effort doesn't even match ours. It is unfair to us, disrespectful for users, and shame on their public image.

## The Culture

Discord attracts a lot of right-wing users.

* There are some anti-MAP vigilantes around Discord. Some display alt-right ideologies publicly. At DISBOARD, we also see some of them, using potentially offensive names and avatar, making reports to us.
* [Chan users](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/8chan-users-are-moving-to-discord-where-your-kids-are-playing-video-games/) like Discord.
* Discord has [not one](https://discordleaks.unicornriot.ninja/discord/) [but two](https://whispers.ddosecrets.com/) known alt-right leaks. It is a target a journalists.
* Discord [indirectly caused Charlottesville](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/07/subpoena-for-app-called-discord-could-unmask-identities-of-charlottesville-white-supremacists/), until they shut the server down... [at a convenient time](https://nitter.net/discordapp/status/897170310348263426).

Discord also attracts [fandoms](https://www.themarysue.com/fandom-decamps-to-discord/) and [influencers](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/how-discord-went-mainstream-influencers/584671/). Why?

Keyword: Attention. Discord is built on quantified attention. Whereas Instagram is one-way attention (following), Discord is bi-way (chat). It is why Discord is able to grow an entire ecosystem out of it: Bots, server listings, fandoms, servers...

...until people differentiate themselves based on the attention they have. And Discord is not helping.

1\. Division.

Thousands of bots contribute to the Discord experience and therefore become part of the culture, with bot developers enjoying the attention and achievement from them. However, even before the forced verification of bot developers, we see [Discord staff bashing a platform used by small bot developers](https://support.glitch.com/t/one-of-the-glitch-ips-is-banned-by-discord/4377/3) and [putting blame on bots first](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/1276). Now, with verification, underage and privacy-aware developers are effectively *barred* from growing their bots. Driven by the culture, the users are encouraged to learn programming and to code projects, becoming indie developers, and they then meet Discord, not only exploiting that culture for data, but also deepening the divide between the mass and a few privileged developers, who have the money to spend.

2\. Distinction.

DISBOARD has reviews. Even though we envisioned it as a fair game for users to comment on servers, it has inevitably become another way to distinct one server from others, as we stopped many attempts of rewarding reviews and raiding reviews. Staff reviewing their own server, though cannot be ruled against, also affects the neutrality of reviews. In other server listings, I also see servers trying to *buy* upvotes with giveaway in order to win competitions. Now look at bots: [Cross-bot voting](https://github.com/DiscordBotList/issues/issues/372) (It was added into the bot list's prohibited actions). Where is the moral bottom line in this? In one way we could also say that Discord, by design, promotes such unfair competition. Also, look at the Server Discovery page! They just choose the *largest* servers to represent Discord, throwing everyone else under the bus. (Also, how did r/Jailbreak become a Discord partner? Why would Discord endorse something that is in the [legal grey area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking#United_States)?)

And with these two comes with...

## The Money

Nitro or PayPal rewards servers have long been a phenomenon, where members are paid to join servers. Sponsored nitro giveaways, in which server owners pay large servers to host a giveaway with the requirement of joining their servers, has become a common source of @everyone pings. There's even [a bot](https://top.gg/bot/631117170306449428) for paying people to join servers! All of these show that money plays a key role around *attention*.

On May 19, 2020, Discord officially added this to the Community Guidelines. With zero prior notice, as usual, even if the Terms of Service directly link to the Guidelines! (I was notified by someone in the DISBOARD support server.)

> 15\. You may not sell your account or your server.

This rule addresses professional "server-growers" who attract people through rewarding joins, which sometimes involve scams, then selling off the entire server to someone who wants a pre-made community, like [this](https://redd.it/gwzu5p). Two things:

1. What were you doing *before* then? Are you not aware of Nitro rewards servers?
2. So the server owner can still convert their own nitro-rewards server to a pre-made community, while you earn all the money from it? By barring professionals, aren't you just encouraging everyone to *do it themselves*, therefore getting more money through Nitro gifts?

In addition to the shove-in-the-face addition of the Nitro gift button in the message box, I believe this shows Discord's aggressive practice of *trying to* profit. After all, we're talking about a platform that owns no infrastructure, but instead uses Google backend. They *claim* that it saves money. Really? How many users are there on Discord? Wouldn't it be better if you run your own infrastructure? [On reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/gd7xra/discord_now_displays_a_square_when_you_click_on/fpj3pkx/), in respond to someone saying "I mean Twitter wasn't profitable for many years", I said:

> Well, Twitter is an innovation based on an existing product: a mass SMS service with rich content. [...] And this is why it has been widely adopted for users, from governments to celebrities: it's useful to get short easy-to-read messages out to followers.
> 
> Discord, on the other hand...
>
> * can be hardly called an innovation (Similar to Microsoft Teams, Slack... They simply repurposed it for social media uses)
> * does NOT see wide adoption (apart from gamers and other niche communities, which are not mainstream)
> * does NOT have its own infrastructure (rent Google's; note that Twitter started using own infrastructure ([around 2010](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale.html)) after reaching 65 mil tweets a day ([June 2010](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2010/big-goals-big-game-big-records.html)))
> * is actually desperately trying to cut cost by removing/substituting essential services (like [support staff](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/g7y2xg/discord_its_time_to_stop/fom3vdz/))

Also, as a response to a public outcry to the infamous Android UI change, [someone replied this](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/g7y2xg/discord_its_time_to_stop/fokmhbi/):

> Let me offer a different viewpoint. I agree that Discords UI isn’t great but this is something that always gets overlooked.
> 
> Discord needs money.
>
> They have never been profitable. [It was confirmed by a dev a few days ago](https://reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/g4l7lf/thanks_a_lot_discord_no_one_asked_for_this/fo11exg/). They’ve been held up by VC money the entire time. These VC’s have said this money is going to be a lot stingier due to the economy.
>
> So discord has seen their traffic double in the face of an impending recession while never turning a profit. This is the worst scenario a company could be in. So what should they do? They try to make changes, anything to bring in money. They try to make the UI sleeker, add the nitro button.
>
> They’re between a rock and hard place. The Discord we’ve all known and loved is not sustainable and never will be. I don’t blame them for trying to find a version that is [sustainable?]

With the tainted public image of crimes, the incompetent support members, and the unwillingness to change, no wonder why it is not sustainable.

## Conclusion: The Attitude

In China, [we say](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%91%E7%8E%89%E5%85%B6%E5%A4%96%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%97%E7%B5%AE%E5%85%B6%E4%B8%AD#Idiom):

> 金玉其外，败絮其中。
>
> Idiom: (figuratively) gilded exterior, shabby and ruined on the inside; fly in the ointment; a sugarcoated bitter pill; fair without, foul within

Maybe Discord does look good from the outside: After all, it continues in attracting users and [investors](https://discord.com/company). But inside, it's a cesspool. If Discord truly cares about running the platform, they must listen to users and make the insides as pretty as the outsides. Otherwise, with such a big focus on public image and short-term profiting, I fail to see any purpose of Discord other than these two:

1. To attract users and gather more data.
2. To eventually sell off the company (and the data).

This does not mean they should not focus on short-term gains at all - We cannot deny the nature of a company - but that they did not realize the long-term harm of their decisions.

I do not wish to call everyone to move off Discord - I must recognize that it does bring people together - but as Discord users, you should be informed of these flaws. I also encourage everyone to actively audit Discord's actions and publicize them when necessary.

## Some personal anecdotes

I am a Discord user since March 2016 as I was introduced to it while being a Minecraft player.

I experience both sides of Discord throughout my usage. I saw raids since my first server, learned JavaScript, tried to introduce a global ban list (failed), lost the battle to the 4chan /b/, collaborated on a bot (which was shut down due to lack of host), formally made my own bot ([DTel](https://dtel.austinhuang.me)), worked with [the wrong people](https://blog.usejournal.com/discordlist-net-and-how-to-not-run-a-website-a0694b1ec360?gi=3d9034553595), contacted Taki in a popular server and founded DISBOARD, got banned once for trying to merge one server to another, experienced countless server drama, started the [Advertising Guide](./advertising), became the go-to person in server listing (debatable), tried to bring in [inter-bot collaboration](https://discoin.gitbook.io) (still struggling)... 

I constantly discussed Discord's unprofitability. But what really made me to move my community server to Matrix is Project Blurple, the annual tradition of "celebrating Discord's birthday" by painting your avatar to blurple. I became furious over the people's ignorance on the issues of Discord and just the constant corporate propaganda, then I decided to revisit Riot.im and proposed to [Adam](https://i-am.djelectro.me/) of running a Matrix homeserver, so here I am.

I know not everyone focuses on privacy as much as I do (Otherwise, you'd be reading [this](https://stallman.org/discord.html), [this](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html), [this](https://resynth1943.net/2020/03/14/The-Discord-privacy-scandal.html), and also Cadence's). For those who want to move out of Discord: Matrix with Riot.im should provide a good grip on both open source (as well as privacy) and social. Although it does not see much adoption right now, people will eventually learn about it.

And, again, I don't write as good as Cadence. If you haven't read their article at this point, [do it](https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-fuckdiscord).

## Two supplementary comments

...that I made on r/discordapp which I think should be included here for extra context.

### tracr.co (ex. dis.cool)

From [this comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/eeoxwa/discool_collects_and_illegally_stores_your/fbvzcbw/), which [I got named for](https://nitter.net/tracrco/status/1209432389363142656):

> Before dis.cool comes h0nda1337. Back in the second half of 2018, he scraped [Discord.Me](https://Discord.Me) (which, at the time, required all servers to have widget enabled) and collected "12,000,000 users in 27,287 public discord servers". Someone else sorted this database and posted it onto [discord.dmca.gripe](https://discord.dmca.gripe) ([Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20180910154710/https://discord.dmca.gripe/), actual site no longer exists) under a so-called "censorship-free file hosting". I presume the company behind the host, Snusbase, took the database themselves (probably legal) and placed it behind [a paywalled leaked database search service](https://snusbase.com/).
>
> I discovered dis.cool shortly after. Before I thought it was simply another server listing service (at that time), but then I grew suspicion over having 2 large Discord emotes servers listed with an auto-generated description. After listing my server (now gone, for unrelated reasons) on it, the two owners of the site went on it and I confronted them with my discovery. They insisted it was legal and replied with "then disable ur widget r\*\*\*\*d".
>
> That happened October 16, 2018. Now I see dis.cool has made their purpose of user searching clear (as opposed to masking it behind a server advertising site). So yeah, this site has been there for more than a year and there are no legal clauses to stop them. As to Discord, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/94q293/regarding_recent_bot_activity/) was their response regarding to the first leak. Two quotes: What they did and what they wanted us to do.
> 
>> From our side, as soon as we were made aware of the situation, we started analyzing and investigating, including taking action on accounts which were involved — our first actions were taken no more than two hours after the first reports of the activity. ~~We've continued to monitor and respond to changes in the suspicious account behavior, relying both on our internal systems and on, of course, the reports that have come in.~~ We can also add that it appears there’s some copycat behavior occurring, which we’ve also been addressing.
>
> Just banning accounts that utilizes the leak is totally enough for a security breach! Discord.Me, the affected listing site (which they did not name - I named it for transparency, I applaud [Discord.Me's] approach on this issue), removed widget requirement and implemented opt-in ReCAPTCHA protection for joining, eventually rewrote the entire site. Discord urged people to disable widget - A feature that *nobody* knows will bring great harm, and then:
> 
>> Finally, you may want to consider removing your server from server discovery sites — we understand many servers rely on such to drive traffic, and this would not be an easy decision to make, but we also understand there are servers out there that may have put themselves on these sites once upon a time and then forgot about it.
>
> Discord did not even *recourse* on *their* inability to prevent such abuses from happening, yet *accuses* listing websites for it??? To this day, we're still suffering from unsolicited dating bots, a phenomenon originating in 2017. How did Discord let that many accounts with very similar username patterns on their platform? Are they even able to make an effort on this? We, the users, will never know.

My exchange with the owners of dis.cool (at that time, "October 16, 2018") are detailed [here](https://ibb.co/album/yWqb9Z?sort=title_asc) (warning: coarse language). Note that there were 2 owners, but they become unidentifiable as their accounts are deleted.

I think tracr.co (at least through their Twitter) illustrates the point of "do not use Discord for the sake of privacy" pretty well, although they decided to do it in a horrifying way that actually invades user privacy. h0nda, on the other hand, is much smarter in the maneuver and remains a big player in finding Discord vulnerabilities in a neutral way.

### Bot dev verification

From [this comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/g2msze/since_people_are_apparently_falling_for_this/fnno1so/):

> At the cost of keeping potential real developers away from the platform, knowing that they cannot achieve true success without giving out their ID?
>
> Discord could've hired more staff to remove fake bots, simplify report process, issue IP bans (for bot owners), or test out each bot for verification (like what tens of bot lists are doing every day - if they can do it, you can). You can even be like Telegram and deliberately tag "Scam" on bots. But no. You ask for IDs. You ask bot devs' compliance because you don't want to do your job.
>
> Users, ask yourselves: This kind of issue is not new. Fake bots are along for a long time. Userbots. Scrapers. And I'm sure many have written detailed reports to Discord. Yet they sweep it under the rug until people post again and again in this public sub. Do we have to attempt to damage Discord's public image for their attention every time so that they can finally do a half-assed fix???
>
> Don't *act* all user-first in public. Show real progress!

About "You can even be like Telegram and deliberately tag 'Scam' on bots", they currently rename scam bots to "fake bot don't join" or something like that, which, for me, is extremely unprofessional. Can't you just delete the bot account and all relevant DM channels?

I'd like to thank [Cadence](https://cadence.moe) and [Resynth](https://resynth1943.net) for their insights.

I hope that I have set up an example in examining a platform, and I would like to encourage you to start doing research yourself in order to evaluate every platform you use. In today's fast-moving consumerist society, we need to slow down, and perform a critical analysis on the products... before it's too late. Don't be consumed by the product!

As for Discord, [get a grip of yourself man!](https://invidio.us/watch?v=hAGk4YVhK8M)
